## Schema

### Required

- `deployment_ids` (List of String) List of deployment IDs that can access this credential
- `name` (String) The name of the Gemini access credential
- `project_id` (String) The GCP project ID

### Optional

> **NOTE**: [Write-only arguments](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/resources/ephemeral#write-only-arguments) are supported in Terraform 1.11 and later.

- `description` (String) The description of the Gemini access credential
- `service_account_key` (String, Sensitive) The GCP service account key JSON
- `service_account_key_wo` (String, Sensitive, [Write-only](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/resources/ephemeral#write-only-arguments)) The GCP service account key JSON (write-only). This is a write-only attribute that is more secure than `service_account_key` because Terraform will not store this value in the state file. Either `service_account_key` or `service_account_key_wo` must be specified.
- `service_account_key_wo_version` (String) Used to trigger updates for `service_account_key_wo`. This value should be changed when the service account key content changes. Can be any value (e.g., a timestamp, version number, or hash).

### Read-Only

- `id` (String) The unique identifier of the Gemini access credential
- `kind` (String) The kind of access credential
- `type` (String) The type of access credential
