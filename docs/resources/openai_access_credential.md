## Schema

### Required

- `deployment_ids` (List of String) List of deployment IDs that can access this credential
- `name` (String) The name of the OpenAI access credential

### Optional

> **NOTE**: [Write-only arguments](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/resources/ephemeral#write-only-arguments) are supported in Terraform 1.11 and later.

- `api_key` (String, Sensitive) The OpenAI API key
- `api_key_wo` (String, Sensitive, [Write-only](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/resources/ephemeral#write-only-arguments)) The OpenAI API key (write-only). This is a write-only attribute that is more secure than `api_key` because Terraform will not store this value in the state file. Either `api_key` or `api_key_wo` must be specified.
- `api_key_wo_version` (String) Used to trigger updates for `api_key_wo`. This value should be changed when the API key content changes. Can be any value (e.g., a timestamp, version number, or hash).
- `description` (String) The description of the OpenAI access credential
- `project_id` (String) The OpenAI project ID (must start with 'proj_')

### Read-Only

- `id` (String) The unique identifier of the OpenAI access credential
- `kind` (String) The kind of access credential
- `type` (String) The type of access credential
