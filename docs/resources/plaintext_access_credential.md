# hush_plaintext_access_credential (Resource)

Manage plaintext access credentials in the Hush Security platform. Plaintext credentials store a single secret value that can be delivered as an environment variable to specified deployments.

## Example Usage

```terraform
# Create a plaintext access credential with standard secret storage
resource "hush_plaintext_access_credential" "example" {
  name           = "example-api-key"
  description    = "API key for external service integration"
  deployment_ids = ["dep-example123456789"]
  secret         = "sk-1234567890abcdef"
}

# Create a plaintext access credential with write-only secret (enhanced security)
# The secret value will not be stored in Terraform state
resource "hush_plaintext_access_credential" "example_write_only" {
  name              = "example-api-key-secure"
  description       = "API key with enhanced security (not stored in state)"
  deployment_ids    = ["dep-example123456789"]
  secret_wo         = "sk-1234567890abcdef"
  secret_wo_version = "v1" # Change this value when rotating the secret
}

# Output the credential ID for reference
output "credential_id" {
  value = hush_plaintext_access_credential.example.id
}

output "credential_type" {
  value = hush_plaintext_access_credential.example.type
}
```

## Schema

### Required

- `deployment_ids` (List of String) List of deployment IDs that can access this credential
- `name` (String) The name of the plaintext access credential

### Optional

> **NOTE**: [Write-only arguments](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/resources/ephemeral#write-only-arguments) are supported in Terraform 1.11 and later.

- `description` (String) The description of the plaintext access credential
- `secret` (String, Sensitive) The secret value for the plaintext credential
- `secret_wo` (String, Sensitive, [Write-only](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/resources/ephemeral#write-only-arguments)) The secret value for the plaintext credential (write-only). This is a write-only attribute that is more secure than `secret` because Terraform will not store this value in the state file. Either `secret` or `secret_wo` must be specified.
- `secret_wo_version` (String) Used to trigger updates for `secret_wo`. This value should be changed when the secret content changes. Can be any value (e.g., a timestamp, version number, or hash).

### Read-Only

- `id` (String) The unique identifier of the plaintext access credential
- `type` (String) The type of access credential (always PLAINTEXT for this resource)
