# hush Provider

The Hush Security provider is used to interact with Hush Security platform resources for managing deployments and security configurations.

To use the provider, you must have valid Hush Security API credentials. You can configure the provider in several ways:

- Using the `api_key_id`, `api_key_secret`, and `realm` parameters directly in the provider configuration
- Using the `HUSH_API_KEY_ID`, `HUSH_API_KEY_SECRET`, and `HUSH_REALM` environment variables
